# KFC_Multithreading

*This is an application which simulates the KFC order system on the purpose of getting familiar with Java multithreading.*  

Too lazy to write the readme... 

**The files end with .md are all log files, which show the whole process from order generating to food serving.** I have already made these logs to markdown files, making it easy to read and understand.

### Have a nice day!
